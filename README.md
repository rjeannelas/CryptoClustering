## CryptoClustering

Use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes

#### Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
#### Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
#### Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

- Using the original scaled DataFrame, perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components

#### Answer the following question:
What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
