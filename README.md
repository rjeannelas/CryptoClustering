## CryptoClustering

Use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes

#### Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
- Use the elbow method on the PCA data

### Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
- Initialize the K-means model with the best value for k.
- Fit the K-means model using the PCA data.
- Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data.

### Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- Using the original scaled DataFrame, perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components

#### Answer the following questions:
What is the best value for k?
What is the best value for k when using the PCA data?
Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?
What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
